!!! note
	For each of these problems, you are strongly encouraged
	to read through the problem descriptions,
	especially if you're somewhat new to molecular biology.
	We will mostly not repeat the background concepts in these notebooks,
	except where they are relevant to the solutions.

!!! warning "The Problem"

    A string is simply an ordered collection of symbols selected from some
    alphabet and formed into a word; the length of a string is the number of symbols that it contains.

    An example of a length 21 DNA string (whose alphabet contains the symbols 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T') is "ATGCTTCAGAAAGGTCTTACG."

    **Given**: A DNA string `s`
    of length at most 1000 nt.

    **Return**: Four integers (separated by spaces) counting the respective number
    of times that the symbols 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' occur in `s`
    .

    **Sample Dataset**

    ```
    AGCTTTTCATTCTGACTGCAACGGGCAATATGTCTCTGTGTGGATTAAAAAAAGAGTGTCTGATAGCAGC
    ```

    **Sample Output**

    ```
    20 12 17 21
    ```

Let's see how it's done!

### DNA sequences are `String`s of `Char`s

In julia, single characters and strings,
which are made up of multiple characters, have different types.
`Char` and `String` respectively.

They are also written differently - single quotes for a `Char`,
and double quotes for a `String'.


```@example dna
chr = 'a'
str = "A"
typeof(chr)
```

```@example dna
typeof(str)
```

In many ways, a `String` can be thought of as a vector of `Char`s,
and many julia functions that operate on collections like `Vector`s
will work on `String`s.
We can also loop over the contents of a string,
which will treat each `Char` separately.


```@example dna
for c in "banana"
	@info c
end
```



### Approach 1: counting in loops

One relatively straightforward way to approach this problem
is to set a variable to `0` for each base,
then loop through the sequence, adding `1` to the appropriate
variable at each character.

I'll also stick this into a function,
so we can easily reuse the code.

```@example dna
function countbases(seq) # here `seq` is an "argument" for the function
	a = 0
	c = 0
	g = 0
	t = 0
	for base in seq
		if base == 'A'
			a += 1 # this is equivalent to `a = a + 1`
		elseif base == 'C'
			c += 1
		elseif base == 'G'
			g += 1
		elseif base == 'T'
			t += 1
		else
			# it is often a good idea to try to handle possible mistakes explicitly
			error("Base $base is not supported")
		end
	end
	return (a, c, g, t)
end

countbases("AAA")
```

Now let's see if it works on the example dataset.
Remember, we should be getting the answer `20 12 17 21`

```@example dna
answer = "20 12 17 21"
input_dna = "AGCTTTTCATTCTGACTGCAACGGGCAATATGTCTCTGTGTGGATTAAAAAAAGAGTGTCTGATAGCAGC"
countbases(input_dna)
```

Well, the formatting is just a bit different -
The julia type is a `Tuple`, which is surrounded by parentheses.
To fix this, we can use the `join` function.

```@example dna
@assert join(countbases(input_dna), " ") == answer
```


### Approach 2: using `count()`

Another approach is to use the built-in `count()` function,
which takes a "predicate" function as the first argument
and an iterable collection as the second argument.
The predicate function must take each element of the collection,
and return either `true` or `false`.
The `count()` function then returns the number of elements
that returned `true`.

For example, if I define the `lessthan5()` function
to return `true` if a value is less than 5,
I can then use it as a predicate to count the number of values
in a `Vector` of numbers that are less than 5.


```@example dna
function lessthan5(num)
	return num < 5
end

count(lessthan5, [1, 5, 6, -3, 3])
```

Often, we don't want to have to define a simple function like `lessthan5()`
for every predicate we want to test, especially if they will only be used once.
Instead, we can use an "anonymous" function (also sometimes called "lambdas")
as the first argument.

In julia, anonymous functions have the syntax `arg -> func. body`.
In other words, the same expression above could be written as:


```@example dna
count(num -> num < 5,  [1, 5, 6, -3, 3])
```

Here, `num -> num < 5` is identical to the definition for `lessthan5(num)`.

So, now we can write a different formulation of `countbases()` using `count()`:

```@example dna
function countbases2(seq)
	a = count(base-> base == 'A', seq)
	c = count(base-> base == 'C', seq)
	g = count(base-> base == 'G', seq)
	t = count(base-> base == 'T', seq)
	return (a,c,g,t)
end
```

```@example dna
@assert countbases2(input_dna) == countbases(input_dna)
```


!!! tip
	Even though this approach is quite a bit more suscinct,
	it might end up being a bit slower than `countbases`, since
	it has to loop over the sequence 4 times instead of just once.

	Sometimes, you need to make trade-offs between clarity and efficiency.
	One of the great things about `julia` is that a lot of ways of approaching
	the same problem are often possible, and often fast (or they can be made fast).


### Approach 3: using BioSequences.jl

The `BioSequences.jl` package is designed to efficiently work
with biological sequences like DNA sequences.
`BioSequences.jl` efficiently encodes biological sequences using
special types that are not `Char` or `String`s.

```@example dna
using BioSequences

seq = LongDNA{2}(input_dna)

sizeof(input_dna)
```

```@example dna
sizeof(seq)
```

Counting individual nucleotides isn't the most common operation,
but `BioSequences.jl` has some [advanced searching](https://biojulia.github.io/BioSequences.jl/stable/sequence_search/) functionality
built-in. It's a bit overkill for this task, but for completeness:


```@example dna
function countbases3(seq)
	a = count(==(DNA_A), seq)
	c = count(==(DNA_C), seq)
	g = count(==(DNA_G), seq)
	t = count(==(DNA_T), seq)
	return (a,c,g,t)
end

@assert countbases3(seq) == countbases2(input_dna)
```



### Benchmarking

Julia programmers like speed,
so let's benchmark our approaches!



```@example dna
using BenchmarkTools

testseq = randdnaseq(100_000) #this is defined in BioSequences
testseq_str = string(testseq)

@benchmark countbases($testseq_str)
```


```@example dna
@benchmark(countbases2($testseq_str))
```

```@example dna
@benchmark countbases3($testseq)
```



Interestingly, on my system, `countbases2()` is actually faster than `countbases()`,
at least for this longer sequence. This may be because [SIMD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_instruction,_multiple_data) lets the calls to `count()` work in parallel.

But, as you can see, `countbases3()` is even faster. Let me make one more function that mimics the behavior of the original `countbases()` but uses `BioSequences.jl` instead.

```@example dna
function countbases4(seq)
	a = 0
	c = 0
	g = 0
	t = 0
	for base in seq
		if base == DNA_A
			a += 1 # this is equivalent to `a = a + 1`
		elseif base == DNA_C
			c += 1
		elseif base == DNA_G
			g += 1
		elseif base == DNA_T
			t += 1
		else
			# it is often a good idea to try to handle possible mistakes explicitly
			error("Base $base is not supported")
		end
	end
	return (a, c, g, t)
end

@benchmark countbases4($testseq)
```
