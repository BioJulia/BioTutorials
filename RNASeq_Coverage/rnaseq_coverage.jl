# RNA-Seq Coverage
#
# **Requirements**:
#
# - Julia 1.6+
# - BioSequences.jl v2
# - BioAlignments.jl v2
# - Xam.jl
# - ProgressMeters.jl
#
# In this tutorial we uses a public RNA-Seq data downloaded from the Sequence Read Archive (SRA):
# http://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/?run=SRR1238088.
# Paired-end FASTQ sequence files were extracted from the archive file
# and aligned to a reference genome using a couple of non-julia programs
#
