# 🧑‍🔬 Getting Started with Rosalind.info Problems

If you're just learning bioinformatics,
or diving into a new programming language with an interest in biology,
[Rosalind.info](https://rosalind.info/) is a fantastic resource!
It has a series of problems that get progressively harder,
and introduce different concepts.

These tutorials will take you through how to solve many of the problems,
both using functionality from the Base Julia language,
as well as using functionality from the BioJulia family of packages.

Once you've signed up for an account at rosalind.info, come on back here,
and we'll get started!
